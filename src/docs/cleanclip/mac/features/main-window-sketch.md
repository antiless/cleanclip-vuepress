# Collection Lists - Automatic Collection

Select a collection list, enable the automatic collection option below, and any content you copy will be automatically collected into the specified folder.

You can set an alias for it, so you can easily open this folder and access its contents anytime.

Many apps, especially content creation apps like Sketch and Final Cut Pro, lack useful bookmarking features.

If the apps you frequently use don't support bookmarking, this feature will be incredibly useful for you!

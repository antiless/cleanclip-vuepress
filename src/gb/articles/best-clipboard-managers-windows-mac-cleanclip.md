# How to Copy Multiple Items to Clipboard? Best Clipboard Managers for Windows and Mac

![](/images/clipboard.png)

In our daily work, we often need to copy and paste text, links or images. While this operation seems simple, it can become very troublesome when dealing with multiple pieces of information simultaneously or retrieving previously copied content. This is where an excellent clipboard manager can be a lifesaver.

A clipboard manager is a tool that runs in the background and keeps track of all your recent copy actions (automatically ignoring sensitive information like passwords). With it, you can easily retrieve previous links, merge multiple clipboard entries, create templates, and synchronize clipboard contents across different platforms.

Depending on your needs, you can choose a simple and user-friendly clipboard manager or opt for a more feature-rich advanced version. Below, we will introduce some clipboard managers that combine simplicity and power:

## Built-in Clipboard History Feature in Windows

Windows 10 and 11 come with a basic clipboard history feature. You can enable "Clipboard History" in "Settings > System > Clipboard." Once enabled, you can press Windows + V to open a floating panel that displays a list of recently copied texts.

While this feature meets basic needs, it lacks advanced functionalities like merging entries and creating templates. If you need a more powerful clipboard management tool, consider trying CleanClip.

## Other Options for Windows

In addition to CleanClip, there are several other excellent clipboard managers available for Windows:

**Ditto**: A lightweight open-source software that supports grouping and merging functionality.

**1Clipboard**: A cross-platform application that syncs clipboard contents through Google Drive.

**ClipClip**: A feature-rich tool that supports grouping, saving, organizing, and merging clipboard entries.

1. **System-Level Design**: The UI and interaction design feel like a native clipboard built into the Mac system.

2. **Immersive Experience**: A clean dropdown appears at the input field, allowing for one-click paste without opening a new window, moving your eyes away, or interrupting your workflow.

3. **Three Main Uses**: Offers a shortcut menu, paste queue, and main window to satisfy different usage scenarios.

4. **Smart Categorization**: Automatically categorizes copied content into text, images, links, etc.

5. **Quick Filtering/Search**: A powerful filtering and search function that helps you quickly locate the content you need.

6. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Supports a variety of keyboard shortcuts for improved operational efficiency.

**CopyClip**: A free and simple menu bar clipboard manager.

**Maccy**: A lightweight, keyboard-friendly clipboard manager that operates similarly to Spotlight.

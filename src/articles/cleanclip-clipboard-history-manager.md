# Tired of Losing Important Content After Copying? CleanClip Helps You Keep Everything You Need

In our daily work, we often need to copy and paste various snippets of information, but sometimes we forget to save them or accidentally overwrite important content when copying new information. This can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you realize you've lost something important.

So, is there a way to view your clipboard history? Unfortunately, macOS does not have this feature built-in, but we can achieve it by installing a third-party application. Today, I'm excited to introduce an excellent clipboard management tool - [CleanClip](https://cleanclip.cc).

CleanClip is a powerful clipboard manager that can help you:

1. Save your clipboard history and easily view and restore previously copied content
2. Smartly categorize different types of clipboard content, such as text, images, files, etc.
3. Support a search function for quickly locating needed content  
4. Provide keyboard shortcuts for more efficient copying and pasting
5. Allow sequential pasting, which works perfectly with high-volume copy-paste workflows

Using CleanClip is very straightforward. Once installed, it runs quietly in the background. When you need to view your clipboard history, simply click the menu bar icon or use a keyboard shortcut to bring up the main interface:

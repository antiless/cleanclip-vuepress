We use copy and paste every day, but losing certain content from the clipboard can be frustrating. In this article, you'll learn how to use third-party tools to view clipboard history on Mac, allowing you to manage it more effectively.

## Why Mac Doesn't Have Native Clipboard History Viewing

**On Mac, you cannot natively view clipboard history** because macOS only retains the most recently copied item. Each time you copy new content, it replaces the previous content. Apple keeps this feature simple for ease of use and to reduce security risks.

Unlike Windows, macOS doesn't have a built-in clipboard history manager. To view and manage multiple copied items, you need third-party tools like **CleanClip**, which allow you to efficiently store, search, and organize your clipboard history.

## How to Use Third-Party Tools to View Clipboard History

Here's a step-by-step guide on using third-party tools to view clipboard history:

**Warning**: Clipboard managers store all the data you copy, including sensitive information. Unless you clear the history afterwards, avoid copying passwords, bank details, or other confidential data, or set up exclusions in the settings.

### 1. CleanClip

**[CleanClip](https://cleanclip.cc)** is a powerful Mac clipboard manager that can easily store and manage an unlimited number of clipboard items. Here are the steps to view clipboard history using CleanClip:

1. Download and install CleanClip from the [CleanClip official website](https://cleanclip.cc)/Mac App Store/brew.

# Automatically Follow Front-Most App

After enabling the Follow Front-Most App mode, the app filter will automatically switch to display the clipboard history for whichever app is currently active in the foreground.

This mode can be combined with lists to unlock many powerful use cases. You can create dedicated clipboard spaces for each app, unleashing their full potential.

# Favorites List - Automatic Collection

Select a favorites list and enable the automatic collection option below, the content you copy will be automatically collected to the specified directory.

You can set an alias for it, and easily access this directory for later use.

Many apps, especially content creation apps like Sketch, Final Cut Pro, etc., lack a useful favorites function.

If your frequently used apps do not support the favorites feature, then this feature will be very useful to you!

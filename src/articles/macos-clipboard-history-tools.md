# How to View Clipboard History on macOS?

I often copy and paste various bits of information and then forget to save them. I'll copy something else and end up losing the content that was previously on the clipboard.

Is there any built-in method in macOS to view clipboard history? Or do I need to install additional software?

While macOS does not have a built-in clipboard history feature, there are many third-party applications that can provide this functionality:

1. CleanClip

- System-level experience
- Immersive interaction design
- Paste queue support

No matter which one you choose, these tools can greatly enhance your productivity, so you no longer have to worry about losing important clipboard content.

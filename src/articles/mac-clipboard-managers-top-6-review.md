## What is a Clipboard Manager?

macOS itself doesn't provide access to the system clipboard, meaning you can't visually see all the items you've cut and copied. You can only see the last item you cut or copied. Clipboard managers enhance the system clipboard's functionality by storing cut and copied data (such as text, images, files, etc.) in a unified panel, allowing you to recall these items as needed.

If you need to repeatedly cut, copy, and paste multiple items, a clipboard manager is an essential tool to make your work easier. You don't have to switch back and forth between folders and files to highlight, cut or copy, and then paste data.

### What Should You Consider When Choosing a Clipboard Manager?

When selecting a clipboard manager, in addition to personal preferences and needs, you should consider the following:

1. **History Capacity** - The number of items or capacity each clipboard manager can store varies.
2. **Supported Data Types** - It's important to understand which data types various clipboard managers support.
3. **User Interface** - Consider whether its user interface (UI) is friendly and provides the clipboard item view and access method you need.
4. **Customizability** - The clipboard manager should offer features like custom shortcuts for faster management of clipboard data.
5. **Application Integration** - Look for a widely used clipboard manager that works with different operating systems and is designed to integrate with the applications or software you need.
6. **Platform Support** - If you use multiple devices to cut, copy, and paste items, you should choose a clipboard manager that works across all these devices.
7. **Price** - You can choose between paid applications or use free ones. There are extensive options for both.

The following six Mac clipboard managers offer different prices, features, and selling points, with some supporting cross-platform use. Read carefully and choose the tool that best fits your clipboard management needs.

### 3. Paste

**Price:** $3.99 monthly subscription, no one-time purchase option

Among all the clipboard management apps in this list, [Paste](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paste-clipboard-manager/id967805235) is the tool that supports iCloud sync and pasting to compatible apps. If you need to copy, cut, or paste items using multiple Apple devices (Mac, iPad, and iPhone), Paste is the best choice as you can access your clipboard items across different devices.

#### Pros

* Allows categorization of clipboard items
* Supports iCloud sync
* Available for iPadOS and iOS
* Supports multiple pastes

#### Cons

### 4. Clipy

**Price:** Free

[Clipy](https://clipy-app.com/) is a lightweight clipboard manager available for free from GitHub. While it lacks basic features like search, this absence of major functions makes it a good choice for users with fewer clipboard management needs. Additionally, it has a compact user interface that integrates well with macOS Ventura.

#### Pros

* Clean user interface
* Suitable for occasional clipboard management needs

You can browse the clipboard through its search function, which is uncommon in free clipboard managers. It's suitable for large-capacity clipboard management on Mac, but the lack of individual hotkeys makes it less efficient. Its compatibility with macOS, iPadOS, and iOS is a good selling point, but it doesn't support iCloud sync.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I access the clipboard on Mac?

Launch Finder, and with the Finder window open, go to the menu bar and click "Edit -> Show Clipboard". Note that this will only show the last item you cut or copied.

### Can clipboard managers store sensitive information like passwords and credit card information?

Yes. However, we strongly advise against storing sensitive information in clipboard managers. If you need to cut or copy sensitive data, make sure your clipboard manager is not running in the background or from the Mac menu bar.

### Can I limit clipboard managers from accessing certain apps and folders on my Mac?

Yes. Not all Mac clipboard managers allow you to restrict them from saving clipboard items from certain apps. CleanClip, CopyQ, Paste, and Dittostack allow you to add app rules and exceptions.

# Why You Need a Clipboard Manager

We use copy-and-paste on the clipboard everyday, but rarely realize those snippets of text and images contain important sparks of inspiration. They come from moments of creativity, yet can disappear when the computer shuts down.

An excellent clipboard manager automatically saves these easily forgotten fragments, without requiring deliberate effort from you. For example, when browsing the web, you can quickly copy an interesting data point or design idea with a few clicks. Even if you forget the source later, the thought is preserved.

At work, you can also temporarily store needed file paths, meeting codes, etc in the clipboard for easy access later. This allows you to keep important breadcrumbs from your workflow, and incorporate them into new projects seamlessly.

It eliminates the tedious steps of opening other apps to take notes, and avoids overwhelming your notes app with fragmented information. Such a tool persistently retains every passing idea you're prone to forgetting, so you can reignite your creative sparks anytime. It becomes a reliable vault of thoughts to help make full use of your bursts of inspiration.

Having a clipboard manager means you can build your own knowledge base, and manage data, find inspiration, and complete work more efficiently. It will be your most practical creative aide and work companion.

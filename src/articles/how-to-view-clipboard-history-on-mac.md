We use copy and paste every day, but losing some content from the clipboard can be frustrating. In this article, you'll learn how to view clipboard history on a Mac using third-party tools, allowing for more effective management of your copied items.

## Why macOS Does Not Natively Support Clipboard History

**On a Mac, you cannot natively view clipboard history** because macOS only retains the last item you copied. Each time you copy something new, it replaces the previous content. Apple keeps this feature simple for usability and to minimize security risks.

Unlike Windows, macOS does not have a built-in clipboard history manager. To view and manage multiple copied items, you need a third-party tool like **CleanClip**, which allows you to efficiently store, search, and organize your clipboard history.

## How to Use Third-Party Tools to View Clipboard History

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use third-party tools to view your clipboard history:

**Warning**: Clipboard managers will store all the data you copy, including sensitive information. Avoid copying passwords, bank details, or other confidential data unless you clear your history afterwards, or set your preferences to avoid saving such information.

### 1. CleanClip

**[CleanClip](https://cleanclip.cc)** is a powerful clipboard manager for Mac that lets you easily store and manage an unlimited number of clipboard items. Here’s how to view clipboard history using CleanClip:

1. Download and install CleanClip from the [CleanClip website](https://cleanclip.cc)/Mac App Store/brew.

# How to View Clipboard History on macOS?

I often copy and paste various snippets of information and then forget to save them. When I copy something else, I end up losing the content from my previous clipboard.

Is there a built-in way in macOS to view clipboard history? Or do I need to install additional software?

While macOS does not have a built-in clipboard history feature, there are several third-party applications that can provide this functionality:

1. CleanClip

- System-level experience  
- Immersive interaction design  
- Paste queue support  
- Searchable clipboard history  
- Install via Homebrew: `brew install --cask cleanclip`

No matter which you choose, these tools can significantly enhance your productivity, allowing you to never worry about losing important clipboard content again.

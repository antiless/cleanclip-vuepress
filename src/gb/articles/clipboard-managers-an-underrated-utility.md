# Clipboard Managers: An Underrated Utility

We've all been there - you copy some text or an image to paste elsewhere, only to accidentally copy something else before pasting.

Clipboard managers elegantly solve this issue by maintaining a history of your clipboard:

1. They grant you access to anything you've previously copied. They offer many more benefits as well.

2. A key advantage of clipboard managers is decoupling copy and paste. You can copy snippets from multiple sources before pasting where needed. No more toggling between applications and windows. Just copy, copy, copy, then paste, paste, paste. A more efficient workflow.

3. Clipboard managers also provide quick access to text snippets, especially frequently used items like passwords and contact information. Everything you need is securely stored in one place, making it easy to access when logging into websites and services. No more hunting for that promo code in your notes.

Of course, for highly sensitive credentials, you should use dedicated password managers. But for low-risk logins, clipboard managers offer a convenient option for managing your passwords.

Like many power user tools, clipboard managers offer an elegantly simple solution to a frustrating problem. Once integrated into your workflow, you'll miss them when they're not available. And they're free!

**That's the beauty of clipboard managers.**

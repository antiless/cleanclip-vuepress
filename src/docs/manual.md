## User Scenarios

### Finding past text records
I have copied a piece of code, document information, or text, but I didn't save it in the snippet in time. As long as I remember a clue, I can directly search for the clue in the clipboard records.

### Filling out forms with multiple text segments to copy back and forth
I need to fill out some forms, which require entering phone numbers, addresses, ID numbers, email addresses📮, etc.

In the past, I might have manually entered each time or copied the phone number from a file, switched to the webpage, and pasted it. Then I would go back to the file, copy the address, switch to the webpage, and paste it.

With CleanClip, I can sequentially "⌘ + C" the phone number, address, ID number, email address📮 in the file, and then go back to the webpage: "⌘ + ;" to select the phone number, "⌘ + ;" to select the address, and so on. No need to switch back and forth anymore.

### Syncing mobile📱 information to computer💻
When browsing Little Red Book on my phone, I come across some great content in image and text posts that I want to organize into a document on my computer💻.

The steps in the past were very cumbersome. You can skip the following steps and focus on one thing you don't even want to look at. You can directly jump to the last part to see how to use CleanClip:
On the phone, repeat the following steps multiple times:
1. Save the image and copy a portion of the text.
2. Open WeChat, import the image, and paste the text.
3. Go back to Little Red Book, copy another portion of the text.
4. Go back to WeChat and paste the text.
5. Repeat steps 1-4.
On the computer💻:
1. Copy the image in WeChat.
2. Paste the image in the text editor.
3. Copy the text in WeChat.
4. Paste the text in the text editor.

Using CleanClip:
1. Copy the image, copy the text, copy the image, copy the text... in Little Red Book.
2. On the computer, in the editor, select the copied text one by one using "⌘ + ;".

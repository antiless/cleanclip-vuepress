# How to Use the Mac Clipboard? Frequently Asked Questions

The clipboard feature is an incredibly handy tool for Mac users. It’s the program within macOS that helps you transfer images and text when you copy and paste.

Whenever you use the common shortcuts Command/⌘+X (cut) or Command/⌘+C (copy), your Mac conveniently stores the copied content in the clipboard. This saved content can then be accessed later by using the Command/⌘+V (paste) shortcut. However, if we don't paste it, we may quickly lose it and need to start over. The benefit of the clipboard feature is that it saves the cut or copied content until you decide (or remember) to paste it.

In this brief article, we will explore some common questions about the MacBook clipboard feature.

## Where is the Clipboard on Mac?

On any Mac, you can find the clipboard through the Finder application, which runs in the background while you work on your computer.

Follow these three steps to view the clipboard contents on Mac at any time:

1. Open Finder.
2. Click "Edit" from the top menu.
3. Select "Show Clipboard."

This will display the contents of the clipboard for you to view. The clipboard content here is the result of your last copy operation on your Mac.

## Pasting from the Mac Clipboard

When you hold the Command/⌘ key and press V, your Mac will automatically paste the clipboard content into the new destination.

If you don’t see the newly copied content after performing the Command+V operation, check your clipboard. You may have accidentally cleared the clipboard content. You will need to use Command/⌘+C or Command/⌘+X to copy or cut content again before you can paste it.

## Pasting Mac Clipboard Content into iPad or iPhone

To paste content copied from Mac on your iPad, find the location where you want to paste the text, then click and hold. You will see a prompt to paste the content. This ability to copy and paste content and images between Apple devices requires using the Universal Clipboard feature, which has been available since macOS Sierra.

The Universal Clipboard allows you to copy text from one Apple device and paste it onto another device using the Handoff feature of the Apple ecosystem.

To use this feature, your Apple devices must have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Handoff enabled in System Preferences (on Mac) and Settings (on iOS devices). You must be signed into iCloud with the same Apple ID on all devices.

It is important to note that when using the Universal Clipboard, the copied text is only available for a short period of time.

## Clearing Clipboard Content on Mac or iPhone

The easiest way to clear the clipboard on your MacBook or iPhone is to copy a space character using any application. For example:

1. Open the Notes app.
2. Place the cursor in the editing box.
3. Press the spacebar.
4. Click and hold the space you just created, then select All.
5. Click Copy.

This will add a blank space to the clipboard and replace the previous content. There is no direct option to delete the clipboard content.

## Moving Screenshots Directly to MacBook's Clipboard

You can move screenshots directly to the MacBook's clipboard by customizing the screenshot utility on your Mac.

Here's how to set it up:

1. Press Shift+Command/⌘+5 to open the new screenshot tool.
2. Click Options.
3. Select "Clipboard" as the destination to "Save to."
4. Click the "X" to exit the screenshot utility.

Another way to send screenshots directly to the MacBook clipboard is to hold the Control key while capturing.

## Opening the Clipboard on Mac while Using Microsoft Word or Excel

If you are using Microsoft Office applications like Word or Excel, you can still view the contents of the clipboard by opening it through the Finder application.

Microsoft has also implemented additional option layers when trying to paste content from the clipboard into another application (like Word).

## Copying Text Between Terminal Application and Clipboard

If you are using the Terminal application on Mac, and want to copy text (command, result) while making it available in the clipboard, you can use the pbcopy command to directly input output into the clipboard.

For example, open the Terminal application and type cal | pbcopy.

Similarly, you can use the pbpaste command on Mac to place the information from the clipboard into the terminal application’s display (stdout).

## How to Get Multiple Clipboards on MacBook?

Unfortunately, if you are looking for an advanced clipboard manager to use on Mac, you'll need to look into third-party applications. These applications not only allow you to use multiple clipboards but also enable you to track the clipboard content history and manage it.

However, CleanClip offers a powerful solution. It supports multiple clipboards and features like clipboard history management, smart categorization, and paste queues.

## Can You View Clipboard History on Mac?

Yes, but not using the standard clipboard function offered by Mac. You need to use third-party applications that provide this feature. Many Mac applications can keep a history of clipboard contents.

CleanClip is an excellent choice. It not only provides clipboard history functionality but also supports smart searching, customizable shortcuts, and privacy protection features.

# Automatic Follow Frontmost App

When you enable the mode to follow the frontmost app, the application filter will automatically change to match the frontmost app and display the history of copied items for that app.

This mode, when used in conjunction with the list, opens up many possibilities, allowing you to create dedicated collections for each app and unleash their full potential.

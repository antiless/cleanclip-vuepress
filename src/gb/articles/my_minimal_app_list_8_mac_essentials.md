# My Curated List of Essential Mac Applications

When formatting my Mac computer, I installed all the applications I could think of, but there were still some omissions.

Here's my recommended list of applications that I use and love:

[CleanClip](https://cleanclip.cc) - Everything about the clipboard. Many people might think clipboard management isn't important, I used to think so too, until I started using it, and now I can't live without it.

[RayCast](https://www.raycast.com/) - This is probably the app I use the most. It has many features, but I mainly use it to switch windows, set up a calendar in the menu bar, and view events.

[Bear](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1091189122) - I've tried Apple Notes and many other apps, but Bear is the best choice for me.

[Things](https://apps.apple.com/app/things-3/id904280696) - Beautiful, simple, easy to use, and works well with Bear. Recommended reading: [The Fu Master Productivity Checklist Using Things3](https://productivewithapurpose.com/2019/05/21/the-fu-master-productivity-checklist-using-things3/).

[CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) - I'm still using it for reasons similar to the CleanClip app.

[ScanTexter](https://apps.apple.com/app/scantexter-ocr-ai-translate/id1635954549) - I often need to translate and read content immediately, and this app allows me to view it easily anytime. I also frequently use it to capture and copy content.

[DayMoney](https://apps.apple.com/app/daymoney-budget-diary/id6443419421) - My wife and I share this app, so it's easy to keep track of our finances. It's more convenient to use if you set up text message shortcuts and Apple Pay shortcuts on iPhone.

[AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com/) - The battery performance of my MacBook purchased in February 2023 is still at 100%.

I've tried and installed many apps, but in the months after formatting, I only use these apps without feeling any inconvenience. In fact, because it simplifies my way of thinking, I can now spend more time on more important things.

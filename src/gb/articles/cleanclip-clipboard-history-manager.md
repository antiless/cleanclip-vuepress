# Tired of Important Content Being Overwritten After Copying? Don't Worry, CleanClip Helps You Keep All Important Information

In our daily work, we often need to copy and paste various snippets of information, but sometimes we forget to save them, or we accidentally overwrite important content when copying new information. This can be very frustrating, especially when you realize that important information has been lost.

So, is there a way to view the clipboard history? The macOS system itself does not have a built-in feature for this, but we can achieve it by installing a third-party application. Today, I want to introduce an excellent clipboard management tool - [CleanClip](https://cleanclip.cc).

CleanClip is a powerful clipboard manager that can help you:

1. Save clipboard history, easily view and restore previously copied content
2. Intelligently categorize different types of clipboard content, such as text, images, files, etc.
3. Support search functionality to quickly locate the content you need  
4. Provide shortcut key operations for more efficient copying and pasting
5. Offer sequential pasting capabilities, closely integrate with workflows involving large amounts of copying and pasting

Using CleanClip is very simple; after installation, it will work silently in the background. When you need to view the clipboard history, just click the menu bar icon or use a shortcut key to open the main interface:
